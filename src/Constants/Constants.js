export const  RESEARCH_INFO = "Emotion recognition systems, are developed using various features that may be influenced by the speaker and language dependent information. One of the challenges in development of speech emotion recognition system is identification of suitable features that can effectively characterize the emotions. Therefore, we propose a speech-emotion recognition system that aims to recognize patterns of derived speech features such as Pitch, Energy, MFCC which are then mapped using classifiers. Initially, when, the audio signal is passed to the system, it goes through feature extraction and selection process where the extracted speech features are selected in terms of emotion relevance. Further, the extracted features of the speech are converted into a feature vector, which is used to train the different classification algorithms. We identified suitable models to capture emotion specific information from extracted speech features. One of the major challenges to design a speech emotion recognition system is its robustness. It should be robust enough to process real-life and noisy speech to \n" +

    "identify emotions. The existing emotion recognition systems have been designed for English, Telugu, German and various other languages except Hindi. So, with this motivation we propose an application of speech emotion recognition portal that classifies a Hindi sentence into an emotion (such as happy, sad, angry, surprise and fear) and the functioning of which is illustrated using an example below. Consider an application where the customer is irritated and frustrated with the machine’s response. From the sentence spoken by the speaker we can extract features and use classification model to determine the emotion by considering both text as well as MFFC features of the speech. Once the emotion is identified as “frustration”, the customer should be instantly provided with human assistance to calm him of the frustration because of the lack of response from the machine. On the other hand, if the customer emotion is “Happy”, then the delighted mood increases the probability of the customer to buy related items, when offered to him";
